(** Profiling of the allocation behaviour of OCaml programs.
    For 64-bit targets only.
    This module may only be used when the -allocation-profiling option is
    passed to the compiler.  The option must be passed for all object
    files, library and package constructions involved in the program.
    For functions to decode the information recorded by the profiler,
    see the standard library module [Allocation_profiling_offline]. *)

     available space of annotations.  Need to be careful of [Obj.truncate].

(* [erase_profiling_annotations] erases allocation profiling
   information on all values.  This is useful at the start of some
   benchmarking period---for example to exclude allocations associated
   with one-time startup costs from a profile.  It is also important in
   conjunction with [annotate_values_with_given_integer] (see below).

   [`Out_of_range] is returned if the supplied integer is negative or larger
   than [max_annotation_value ()].
   It is not sensible to mix this kind of annotation with the location
   annotation provided by the OCaml system.  To this end, before using
   [annotate_values_with_given_integer], it is recommended to call
   [erase_profiling_annotations] first.
